This is the source code to the paper "Separate Bombs from Firecrackers: Intention-guided Vulnerability Assessment via LLM". Please refer to the paper for the experimental details.

# Processing
We use Joern to generate code structure diagrams. You can leave a message below. We can also provide the Joern tool compiled in the paper. It should be noted that the graphics generated by different versions of Joern may have significant differences. Therefore, if a newer version of Joern is used to generate the code structure diagram, the performance of the model may differ from the results we reported in the paper.


# About the Models
The model can be runned from codereviewer_rl.py.
Please note that you need to fill in the basic API interface and key. Specifically, openai.api_base="xxx", and openai.api_key="xxx".
